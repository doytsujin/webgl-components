# Contributing

## How to contribute

1.  If you have an idea for a new component please create a new issue and tag Amelie or Henrique before you begin coding.
2.  Components should be lightweight and modular, avoid adding complex components that are project specific.
3.  Ensure your component is tested and validated across major browsers, documenting any gotchas before releasing.
4.  Make sure your changes follow the performance, SEO and accesibility requirements.
5.  Tag Amelie or Henrique to review your component before we publish to npm.
